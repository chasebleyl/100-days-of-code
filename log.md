The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on Monday, January 8th, 2018.

## Log

### [R1D1](#r1-d1)
Created a simple website to upload my log to my personal site at code.100daysof.chasebleyl.com. Next need to configure SSL through a CloudFront distribution, and integrate a Webhook to automatically sync my log from my commits.

### [R1D2](#r1-d2)
Trying to integrate Github and S3 through SNS and Lambda.
